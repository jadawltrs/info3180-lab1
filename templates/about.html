            Hi, my name is Jada Walters. I am a 3rd year computer science major. 
            I like astronomy, flowers and doing my own nails. My favourite constellation is Orion because 
            it's the first one I could identify on my own. I am also a Christian and I take my faith seriously.
            Me and Jesus locked in.
